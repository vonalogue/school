Projects I have created for school as a software development student.


- ### IMS

IMS stands for "Inventory Management System," a desktop program I wrote in Java using NetBeans 8.2. It manages inventory by allowing the user to add, delete, and edit products and their parts, which are stored and displayed in separate tables. JavaFX is used to make the GUI.

- ### ROSTER

This is a console program written in C++. It stores a hypothetical student roster and provides functions in the code that allow the user (programmer) to manipulate the roster.
