Projects I have created for school as a software development student.


- ### IMS

IMS stands for "Inventory Management System," a desktop program I wrote in Java using NetBeans 8.2.
As the name suggests, it is a program that manages inventory by allowing the user to add, delete, and edit products and their parts, which are stored and displayed in separate tables.
